# Huffman-coding

We have single file with main function and inputs included in the code itself. We need to execute the file. 

Logic:
create a priority queue Q consisting of each unique character.
sort then in ascending order of their frequencies.
for all the unique characters:
    create a newNode
    extract minimum value from Q and assign it to leftChild of newNode
    extract minimum value from Q and assign it to rightChild of newNode
    calculate the sum of these two minimum values and assign it to the value of newNode
    insert this newNode into the tree
return rootNode
